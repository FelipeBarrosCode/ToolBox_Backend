## How to get Started

1 Review the schema  of my db and get used to it

2 If you want to add data you are more than welcome just make sure to maybe create another table and to not delete my data

3 all the previous code which I have used to add my data is comented in this script.ts. In addition I have two json files called "ContentgoToDb" and "projects" that contain the data which I am using on my Database

4 USE of enviorment Variables :
    DATABASE_URL--> This is the URL that you need to use to connect to your postgress db using localhost

5 = KEEP Record --> Important to knwo that if you want your code to be used in the working version is recomended that you live a json fiel with the data that you want to contribiute with

6- IF you are done with all these steps just run "npm run devStart"

"To have acces to the frontend just go to my profile and search for ToolBox_Frontend there you will get acces to the frontend of this project"
